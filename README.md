tweetCorp: An R package to work with my Twitter corpora

This package contains functions to search, enrich, or filter a corpus consisting of CSV files. It assumes the columns that are returned by the Twitter Search API.

The syntaxNetR function provides an R binding for Google SyntaxNet. It requires that you have syntaxnet installed on your computer. Currently, syntaxNet is only supported for Linux and Mac OS. You can find the installation instructions here: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/syntaxnet.
